## Technical Decisions & Solutions

### Major Issues Resolved
1. **TailwindCSS v4 Compatibility**
   - Problem: PostCSS plugin errors with TailwindCSS v4
   - Solution: Downgraded to TailwindCSS v3 and fixed configuration

2. **iOS PWA Full-Screen Mode**
   - Problem: Safari navigation bars still visible in PWA
   - Solution: Comprehensive PWA meta tags and manifest configuration
   ```html
   <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
   <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" />
   ```

3. **RSS Feed CORS Issues**
   - Problem: Direct RSS feed access blocked by CORS
   - Solution: Implemented rss2json.com proxy service

4. **React 19 Testing Dependencies**
   - Problem: Peer dependency conflicts
   - Solution: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

5. **PWA Fullscreen Display Mode**
   - Problem: PWA not launching in fullscreen mode when installed
   - Solution: Fixed manifest.webmanifest path reference and added display_override configuration
   - Result: True fullscreen experience on supported platforms

6. **Animation Performance & UX**
   - Problem: Static interface felt less engaging than native apps
   - Solution: Integrated Framer Motion with physics-based animations and proper timing
   - Result: Native app-like interactions with smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component Organization**: Clear separation of UI components, hooks, and utilities
- **State Management**: Local React state + custom hooks (no external state library)
- **Offline-First**: localStorage caching with network fallback
- **Platform Detection**: Custom utility for iOS/Android/Desktop behavior
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
